# Geometry Consistency

**Purpose**: Verify whether in all cases, where the geometry of a spatial object is derived from another spatial object, the geometries of the two objects are consistent.

**Prerequisites**

**Test method**

For all objects in an AM data set, whose [geometry](#geometry) has been derived from another spatial object, compare the geometries of the two objects. The test is passed when the geometries are consistent.

Inspect that the [geometry](#geometry) of each instance [ManagementRestrictionOrRegulationZone](#ManagementRestrictionOrRegulationZone) correspond to an edge in the topological structure formed by the complete boundary graph, including the boundaries of all levels.
