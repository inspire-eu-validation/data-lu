# Projection

**Version**: 1

**Purpose**: Verify that a projection or a set of projections has been defined.

**Prerequisites**

**Test method**

* Based on the INSPIRE horizontal coordinate reference system, each Member State shall define a projection or a set of projections suitable for working with the underlying cadastral parcels on national territory and cross-border areas where applicable for a SpatialPlan. A projection is suitable if it offers few linear alterations (ideally less than 50 cm per 500 m) and so enables users to measure distances and surfaces in meaningful way. This projection or set of projections has to be defined in agreement with neighbouring countries. This projection or set of projections must be well documented to allow the conversion from and to the common Coordinate Reference System. The documentation shall be provided according to ISO 19111, which states how a projected coordinate reference system must be described.
